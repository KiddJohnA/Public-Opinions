    <h1>Public Opinions</h1>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
Currently, to determine the sentiment of a company, I have to search multiple social media and news sites, 
        reading posts and articles, as well as watching videos, just so I can decide if I should buy, sell 
        or hold a company's stock.  And even if the stock I’m researching has good news and a positive sentiment, 
        I still don’t know what other companies have good news and a positive sentiment, let alone which company 
        has the most good news and posts about it.
    </p>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
Public Opinions all media search is useful when researching a company to determine market sentiment.  
        Simply type in a company and Public Opinions searches all relevant social media and news platforms 
        to gather all the information into one place.
    </p>
    <p>
Public Opinions also determines sentiment using natural language processing and counts the number of posts, 
        articles, and videos for each stock so I can know which stocks have the most positive and negative opinions and news at any given time.

Additionally, users can sign-up and log-in to track a watchlist of stocks and view sentiment and volume plotted over time.  
        In the future, Public Opinions may also be used by companies to track how brands and products are perceived by consumers.
