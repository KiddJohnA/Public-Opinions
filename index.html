    <h1>Public Opinions</h1>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
Currently, investors have to search multiple social media and news sites, 
        reading posts and articles, and watching videos just to decide to buy, sell 
        or hold a company's stock.  And even if the company has good news, 
        I still donâ€™t know what other companies have good news, let alone which company 
        has the most good news.
    </p>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
Public Opinions media search is useful to investors when researching a company.  
        Simply type in a company and Public Opinions searches all relevant social media 
        and news platforms and gathers all the information into one place.  Public Opinions 
        also determines the markets sentiment, and counts the number of posts, 
        articles, and videos for each stock so I can know which stocks have the most positive 
        and negative opinions and news at any given time.
