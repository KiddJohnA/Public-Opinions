Project Overview

Problem

Currently, to determine the market's sentiment of a company, I have to search multiple social media and news sites, reading posts and articles, as well as watching videos, just so I can decide if I should buy, sell or hold a company's stock.  And even if the stock I’m researching has good news and a positive sentiment, I still don’t know what other companies have good news and a positive sentiment, let alone which company has the most good news and posts about it.

Plan

Public Opinions all media search is useful when researching a company to determine market sentiment.  Simply type in a company and Public Opinions searches all relevant social media and news platforms to gather all the information into one place.

Public Opinions also determines sentiment using natural language processing and counts the number of posts, articles, and videos for each stock so I can know which stocks have the most positive and negative opinions and news at any given time.

Additionally, users can sign-up and log-in to track a watchlist of stocks and view sentiment and volume plotted over time.  In the future, Public Opinions may also be used by companies to track how brands and products are perceived by consumers.

Design

Users open Public-Opinions.com to a simple, clean dashboard with a search bar to input a company or a ticker.  Below users can see a short list of trending companies that have the most posts with positive and negative sentiment as well as companies with the highest percent change in sentiment and volume.

Upon entering a company or ticker the app displays, in one feed, all recent social media (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and Youtube) mentions as well as news articles and videos (Wall Street Journal, CNBC, Bloomberg, ect.) sorted chronologically or by popularity, ie number of views.  Users can click on a post, article or video to open up the original mention in a new tab.  At the top of each page for each company, is the company's sentiment, as determined by an algorithm, and volume of mentions plotted over time.

Additionally users can click the top right corner at any time to log-in or sign-up to create an account so that they can track a watchlist of stocks, as well as change account information and view an aggregate feed of their watchlist.  Users may also opt-in for email or text alerts when articles for stocks on their watchlist are published.

In the future, Public Opinions may be adapted to include searches for products and brands as well as people, or any keywords, to expand and grow the number of users.
